# Discount Locator - Android app

The theme of this project is an Android application for locating discounts, called "Discount Locator". My team and I had a task to rewrite and convert the app from Java to Kotlin. That's the goal of this paper, describe in detail the process of creating a complete Android project from the installation environment to individual implementations of various features that will later make the finished project, and enable future students to follow the process and be able to develop the entire Android application in the Kotlin programming language with the help of the Android Studio development environment.

Forked from [Discount Locator](https://github.com/AIR-FOI-HR/AIR1909).

Part of course [Software Analysis and Design](https://www.foi.unizg.hr/sites/default/files/software_analysis_and_design.pdf) at [FOI](https://www.foi.unizg.hr/en).
